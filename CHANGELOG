=== FW 3.9 ===
* Configuration option for inverting the motor direction.
* STM32 96-bit unique ID in firmware version command.

=== FW 3.8 ===
* Communication protocol update for floating point variables. This breaks almost all compatibility with old firmwares.

=== FW 3.7 ===
* Delay after app and motor conf write.
 - Fixes NRF bug.
 - Fixes glitches if throttle is given while updating the configurations.
* Lock mc_interface while storing configuration.
* Nunchuk app local timeout.
 - Prevents the output thread from blocking other outputs after being used before.
* Lock MC interface while storing configurations to flash.

=== FW 3.6 ===
* spi_sw for NRF stop bug fix.

=== FW 3.5 ===
* App NRF pairing.
* App nunchuk chuk error restore bug fix.

=== FW 3.4 ===
* HW version built into firmware.
 - Allows VESC Tool to only list firmwares compatible with the hardware.

=== FW 3.2 ===
* hw_60 support.
* hw_das support.
* DRV8301 support.
 - SPI implementation.
 - Some terminal commands.
* DRV8313 support.
* 3 shunt support.
* Phase shunt support.
* Global RPM limit for both BLDC and FOC.
* Hall sensor software filtering.
* SPI software filtering.
* The software filters remove the need for hardware filtering on the sensor port, making it work for all different sensors without modification.
* Handbrake function for FOC (open loop braking).
* FOC updates and fixes.
 - Current control signs.
 - Control loop integrator fixes.
 - Phase delay compensation and minimization.
 - More consistent flux linkage detection.
 - Resistance and inductance measurement bug fix that could cause a reboot.
 - Timer sampling improvement and cleanup.
 - Support for sampling in V0 and V7 when using phase shunts.
* Fix reboot on over temperature fault code.
* Motor temperature measurement and soft backoff.
* Terminal command for rotating magnet field generation (ACIM experimentation).
* Prevent motor start command during initialization.
* Hardware specific default configuration support.
* Stop functionality for apps so that reboots are not required anymore when changing app.
* EEPROM emulation bug fix: https://github.com/vedderb/bldc/issues/27
